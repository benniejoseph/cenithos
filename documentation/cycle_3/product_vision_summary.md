# Product Vision Summary

This document, generated by Agent L1A1, synthesizes the core product vision from all `wealthwise-*` and `cenithos-*` documentation.

## 1. Core Product Concept: "Spatial Finance"

The application, named **WealthWise** (or **Cenithos**), is a next-generation financial intelligence platform for Indian users. It is designed to be an **advisory-only** tool that helps users understand and manage their finances through a highly immersive, 3D, gamified interface. The app **does not execute transactions** but provides analysis, education, and advice.

The core UI/UX philosophy is "Spatial Finance," which transforms financial data into a navigable 3D universe using technologies like **Spline**.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The system is architected as a three-tier application:
-   **Mobile App (Flutter)**: A cross-platform application for iOS and Android built using a Clean Architecture pattern and BLoC for state management.
-   **Backend (Node.js/TypeScript on Firebase)**: A set of microservices (Auth, Transactions, AI Integration, Reports) fronted by an API Gateway. It uses Firestore for the primary database, Redis for caching, and Pinecone for vector storage.
-   **AI Service (Python/FastAPI)**: A sophisticated multi-agent system responsible for all financial analysis and advisory functions. It leverages a suite of specialized agents (Alex, Emma, Thomas, etc.) orchestrated to handle user queries.

## 3. Key Feature Pillars

Based on the documentation, the product is built on the following pillars:

### a. Comprehensive Data Management
-   **Manual & Automated Entry**: Supports manual input, receipt scanning (OCR), CSV imports, and automated data collection from SMS and email (with user permission).
-   **AI-Powered Categorization**: Automatically categorizes transactions with high accuracy and allows for custom rules.

### b. AI-Powered Financial Advisors
-   **A Suite of 6+ Specialized Agents**: Each agent (Expense Coach, Investment Educator, Tax Advisor, etc.) has a distinct personality and advisory role.
-   **Educational & Advisory Focus**: The agents analyze user data to provide insights, recommendations, and educational content. They do not perform transactions.

### c. Advanced Analytics & Reporting
-   **Immersive Dashboards**: Real-time tracking of net worth, expenses, and goals in a gamified, 3D interface.
-   **Predictive Analytics**: The system should forecast expenses, goal achievement timelines, and identify financial opportunities.

### d. Gamification & Education
-   **XP & Level System**: Users earn points and badges for positive financial actions.
-   **Challenges & Leaderboards**: Engages users with savings challenges and anonymous social comparison.
-   **Learning Platform**: Includes structured courses, tutorials, and a knowledge base.

### e. Security & Privacy
-   **Non-Transactional**: The system is read-only, enhancing security.
-   **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
-   **Privacy Controls**: Users have granular control over their data.

## 4. Monetization
-   **Freemium Model**: A free tier with basic features.
-   **Subscription Tiers**: Pro, Family, and Premium plans unlock advanced AI agents, analytics, and support.
