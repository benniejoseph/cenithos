# Release Notes: Cycle 5

**Cycle Goal:** Enhance Transaction Management with Categorization and Filtering & Refine AI Interaction.

## Summary

Cycle 5 focused on delivering a more robust transaction management experience. Key enhancements include the ability to categorize transactions and apply filters based on category and date. The AI assistant has also been upgraded to understand and process filtered transaction queries, making it a more powerful tool for financial analysis.

While the core features were successfully implemented and verified through AI and manual testing, we encountered significant challenges in stabilizing the mobile automated test environment, particularly with asynchronous UI updates and third-party theming libraries. These testing issues will be a high-priority target for resolution in the next cycle.

## New Features & Enhancements

### Backend & API
- **Transaction Model:** The `Transaction` model in Firestore now includes a `category` field.
- **Filtering API:** The `/transactions` API endpoint now supports `category`, `startDate`, and `endDate` query parameters to allow for filtered data retrieval.

### Mobile Application
- **Transaction Categorization:** Users can now assign a category to each transaction they create via an updated "Add Transaction" dialog.
- **Transaction Filtering:** A new filtering sheet has been added to the `TransactionsPage`, allowing users to filter their transaction list by category and pre-set date ranges.
- **UI Enhancements:** The transaction list items now display the category for each transaction.

### AI Assistant
- **Enhanced Query Parsing:** The AI `AgentOrchestrator` can now parse natural language queries for transaction categories and date ranges (e.g., "show me my food expenses for last month").
- **Filtered Tool Calls:** The `get_transactions` tool has been updated to accept and pass on filtering parameters to the backend API, allowing the AI to retrieve specific subsets of a user's transaction data.

## Bug Fixes
- N/A

## Known Issues
- **Mobile Test Failures:** The widget tests for the `TransactionsPage` are currently failing due to issues with asynchronous state updates and theme provider conflicts in the test environment. The functionality has been manually verified, but automated test coverage is lacking.

## Next Steps
- **Stabilize Mobile Testing:** A dedicated effort is required to resolve the ongoing issues with the Flutter widget testing framework to ensure reliable and comprehensive test coverage.
- **Expand AI Capabilities:** Further enhance the AI's natural language understanding to support more complex queries and conversational flows.
