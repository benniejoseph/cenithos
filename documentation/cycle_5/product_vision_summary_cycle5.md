**Author:** L1A1 (Product Vision Analyst)
**Goal:** Enhance Transaction Management with Categorization and Filtering & Refine AI Interaction

## 1. Vision Statement

To empower users with a deeper understanding of their spending habits by transforming the transaction log from a simple list into a categorized, filterable, and intelligently-queried financial analysis tool.

---

## 2. Feature Enhancements

### 2.1. Transaction Categorization (MVP)

-   **Description:** Users should be able to assign a category to each transaction (e.g., "Groceries", "Transport", "Entertainment").
-   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to categorize my transactions so that I can see where my money is going."
-   **Requirements:**
    -   When creating or editing a transaction, the user must be able to select from a predefined list of categories.
    -   The transaction list view must display the category for each transaction.
    -   The backend must store the category information with each transaction record.
    -   A default set of categories will be hard-coded for this MVP (e.g., Groceries, Transport, Bills, Entertainment, Income, Other).

### 2.2. Transaction Filtering

-   **Description:** Users should be able to filter the transaction list to see specific subsets of their data.
-   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to filter my transactions by category and date so I can analyze my spending in specific areas over specific periods."
-   **Requirements:**
    -   The transactions page UI must include a filter button/panel.
    -   Users must be able to filter by category (multi-select or single-select).
    -   Users must be able to filter by a date range (e.g., "This Month", "Last 30 Days", custom range).

### 2.3. AI Interaction Refinements

-   **Description:** The AI assistant's ability to answer questions about transactions should be enhanced to understand the new categorization and filtering capabilities.
-   **User Story:** "As a user, I want to ask the AI assistant questions like, 'How much did I spend on groceries last month?' so I can get quick insights without manual filtering."
-   **Requirements:**
    -   The AI must be able to understand queries that involve categories and timeframes (e.g., "Show me my bills from June", "What were my biggest expenses last week?").
    -   The AI tools (`get_transactions`) must be updated to accept `category` and `date_range` parameters.
    -   The AI orchestrator/agent must be able to parse these parameters from the user's natural language query and pass them to the tool.

## 3. Success Metrics

-   The mobile application allows users to add, view, and categorize transactions.
-   The transaction list can be filtered by at least one category and a date range.
-   The AI assistant can successfully answer a query that includes a category and a date range, returning a filtered list of transactions.
