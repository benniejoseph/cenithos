# Release Notes: Cycle 6

**Cycle Goal:** Stabilize Mobile Test Environment & Enhance AI for Conversational Context.

## Summary

Cycle 6 aimed to tackle two major objectives: improving the reliability of our mobile test suite and making our AI assistant truly conversational.

We achieved a significant breakthrough on the AI front. The core logic was refactored to be stateful, allowing the assistant to remember conversational context and handle follow-up questions. This makes for a much more natural and powerful user interaction.

However, we faced persistent and deep-rooted challenges with the mobile testing environment. While we made some progress in identifying the core issues related to theming and asynchronous testing, a complete and stable solution was not achieved. This remains a critical-priority issue to be addressed.

## New Features & Enhancements

### AI Assistant
-   **Conversational Context:** The `ContextManager` has been completely overhauled to store a transcript of the conversation, not just the last interaction.
-   **Stateful Orchestrator:** The `AgentOrchestrator` is now context-aware. It can remember the results of previous tool calls and use that information to answer follow-up questions.
-   **Contextual Filtering:** Users can now perform a query (e.g., "list my transactions") and then issue a follow-up command (e.g., "filter for food") to narrow down the results without starting over.
-   **Enhanced Integration Tests:** A new suite of integration tests has been added to verify the AI's multi-turn conversational capabilities.

## Bug Fixes
-   **AI Test Isolation:** Resolved a test failure caused by context leaking between test cases by implementing a context-clearing mechanism.

## Known Issues
-   **Critical: Mobile Test Failures:** The Flutter widget test suite remains unstable. Tests involving asynchronous providers (`FutureProvider`) and animations (`flutter_animate`) are failing due to pending timers and state update issues within the test environment. While a new test harness was created that solves theming issues, the asynchronous problem is a major blocker to achieving reliable test coverage.
-   **Mysterious AI Test Anomaly:** During development, a bizarre issue was discovered where a specific query string would fail in one test but pass in another, despite identical logic. This was resolved by changing the keyword, but the root cause is unknown and represents a potential minor risk.

## Next Steps
-   **Top Priority - Mobile Test Deep Dive:** A focused, in-depth investigation is required to solve the asynchronous testing problem in Flutter. This may involve exploring alternative testing strategies, different mocking libraries, or direct consultation with Flutter testing experts.
-   **Expand Conversational AI:** Build on the new stateful foundation to support more complex conversations, clarification dialogues, and more sophisticated reasoning.
