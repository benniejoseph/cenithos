# Product Vision Summary: Cycle 6

**Cycle Goal:** Stabilize Mobile Test Environment & Enhance AI for Conversational Context.

## 1. Vision & Strategy

The vision for Cycle 6 is twofold: **Reliability and Intelligence**.

1.  **Reliability:** We will build developer and user trust by establishing a robust, stable, and comprehensive automated testing suite for the mobile application. A reliable product is a quality product, and that begins with reliable tests. This will accelerate future development, reduce regressions, and improve the overall quality of the app.
2.  **Intelligence:** We will evolve the AI assistant from a simple command processor into a true conversational partner. The AI should remember the context of the conversation, ask clarifying questions, and handle multi-step interactions, making the user experience more natural and powerful.

## 2. User Problems & Target Audience

This cycle targets two main user groups:

-   **Developers:** The primary audience for the testing stabilization effort. The problem is the current lack of confidence in the mobile test suite, which slows down development and introduces risk. Solving this will improve developer productivity and code quality.
-   **End-Users:** The primary audience for the AI enhancements. The problem is the AI's limited, one-shot nature. Users expect a modern AI to be conversational and context-aware. Solving this will significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction with the AI assistant feature.

## 3. High-Level Requirements

### Mobile Test Environment
-   **Dependency Resolution:** Identify and fix the root cause of the `ShadTheme` and asynchronous state update issues in the Flutter test environment.
-   **Test Coverage:** Create a comprehensive suite of widget tests for all existing pages, ensuring they are stable and reliable.
-   **CI Integration:** Ensure that all tests can be run successfully in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.

### AI Conversational Context
-   **Context Management:** Implement a more sophisticated context management system for the AI that tracks conversation history.
-   **Multi-Turn Dialog:** Enable the AI to handle multi-turn conversations, where it can ask clarifying questions and remember previous user inputs.
-   **Stateful Tool-Use:** The AI should be able to remember the results of previous tool calls and use them in subsequent turns of the conversation. For example, a user could ask "show my transactions," and then in the next turn ask, "now filter those by food," and the AI should understand to apply a filter to the previously fetched data.

## 4. Success Metrics

-   **Mobile:** 100% of all mobile widget tests pass consistently in both local and CI environments.
-   **AI:** The AI can successfully handle a 3-turn conversational scenario that requires remembering context and using a tool based on previous turns.
-   **Quality:** A 50% reduction in bugs or regressions reported in features that have established test coverage.
