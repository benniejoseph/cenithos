# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report - Cycle 4

**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Author:** L4A2 (User Acceptance Testing Agent)
**Cycle Goal:** Stabilize the Mobile Test Environment & Implement Transaction Management

---

## 1. Executive Summary

User Acceptance Testing for Cycle 4 has been successfully completed. The two primary goals of the cycle have been met. The mobile test environment is now **stable**, a critical achievement that unblocks future development and verification. The new **Transaction Management MVP** feature has been implemented across the backend, mobile, and AI services and functions as expected. The feature is deemed ready for its intended users.

## 2. Test Scope and Methodology

This UAT was conducted by reviewing the completed development work and the results of the automated integration tests. The focus was on the end-user experience for the new transaction feature and the overall stability of the system.

-   **Phase 1: Mobile Test Environment:** Verified by the successful execution of the mobile widget tests (`flutter test`).
-   **Phase 2: Transaction Management Feature:** Verified by reviewing the implemented UI, the API endpoints, the AI tool integration, and the successful execution of the AI integration tests (`pytest`).

## 3. UAT Results

### 3.1. Mobile Test Environment (Phase 1)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Mobile Test Execution | ✅ **Pass** | The `flutter test` command completes successfully, resolving the critical `[core/no-app]` Firebase error from Cycle 3. This confirms the new Riverpod-based architecture is effective for testing. |

### 3.2. Transaction Management MVP (Phase 2)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Backend API** | ✅ **Pass** | The new `/transactions` endpoint (create, list) is implemented and secured with Firestore rules. |
| **Mobile UI - List View** | ✅ **Pass** | The `TransactionsPage` correctly displays a list of transactions retrieved from the repository. |
| **Mobile UI - Add Dialog**| ✅ **Pass** | The `AddTransactionDialog` successfully allows users to input and save new transactions. The UI is clean and functional. |
| **AI Integration**| ✅ **Pass** | The AI assistant correctly understands queries like "show my transactions" and uses the new `get_transactions` tool to fetch and display the data to the user. |

## 4. Known Issues

No new high-severity issues were identified during this UAT cycle. The primary known issue from Cycle 3 (unstable mobile tests) has been resolved.

---

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendation

Cycle 4 is a success. The remediation of the mobile test environment is a significant technical achievement that improves the overall health of the project. The Transaction Management MVP is a solid new feature that has been well-implemented across the entire stack.

**Recommendation:** The project is ready to proceed to the next development cycle.
