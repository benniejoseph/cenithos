## 1. Introduction

This report outlines the gap between the current state of the CenthiosV2 codebase and the desired state defined in the `product_vision_summary_cycle4.md`. The analysis identifies the specific files and modules that must be created or modified to achieve the cycle's objectives.

## 2. Gap 1: Mobile Testing Framework (High Priority)

- **Description:** The most critical gap is the complete absence of a working mobile test suite. This is a direct result of the unresolved Firebase initialization issues from Cycle 3.
- **Current State:** No test files exist for the mobile app. The `test_helpers.dart` file is present but non-functional.
- **Desired State:** A stable test environment where widget and integration tests can run reliably against a mocked Firebase backend.
- **Affected Files/Modules:**
  - `mobile/centhios/test/` (Directory is mostly empty)
  - `mobile/centhios/test/test_helpers.dart`

## 3. Gap 2: Transaction Management Feature (New)

- **Description:** The application currently lacks any functionality for tracking user transactions. This is a core feature required for the MVP.
- **Current State:** No code related to transactions exists in the backend, mobile, or AI services.
- **Desired State:** A fully implemented MVP for transaction management, including manual entry, a list view, and AI integration.
- **Affected Files/Modules:**
  - **Backend (New):**
    - `backend/functions/src/services/transactions.ts`
    - `backend/functions/src/models/transaction.ts`
  - **Backend (Modification):**
    - `backend/functions/src/index.ts`
  - **Mobile (New):**
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/data/models/transaction_model.dart`
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/data/repositories/transactions_repository.dart`
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/presentation/pages/transactions_page.dart`
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/presentation/widgets/add_transaction_dialog.dart`
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/presentation/widgets/transaction_list_item.dart`
  - **Mobile (Modification):**
    - `mobile/centhios/lib/presentation/pages/main_shell.dart`
  - **AI (New):**
    - New function in `ai/core/tools/financial_tools.py`
  - **AI (Modification):**
    - `ai/core/orchestrator.py`

## 4. Conclusion

The development work for Cycle 4 is clearly divided into two main efforts:
1.  **Remediation:** Fixing the mobile testing framework.
2.  **Feature Development:** Building the Transaction Management MVP.

The remediation work is a blocker for the verification of the new feature work and must be addressed first. The gap analysis provides a clear checklist of the new files to be created and existing files to be modified.
