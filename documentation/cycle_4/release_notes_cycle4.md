## üéâ What's New in This Cycle?

This cycle, our development team focused on two major areas: shoring up our foundations for future reliability and introducing a brand new core feature to help you manage your finances.

### ‚ú® New Feature: Track Your Transactions!

We are excited to introduce the first version of our **Transaction Management** feature! You can now:

-   **Manually add** your income and expenses.
-   **View a list** of your recent transactions right in the app.
-   **Ask our AI assistant** about your spending by saying things like, "show my recent transactions."

This is the first step towards providing a complete picture of your financial health, and we're excited to build on this foundation in future cycles.

### üõ†Ô∏è Under the Hood: A More Stable App

A significant portion of our work this cycle was dedicated to improving the stability and reliability of our mobile application's testing framework. While this work isn't a visible feature, it's a critical investment that allows us to build and test new features more quickly and with higher confidence. This resolves a key issue from our previous cycle and makes our entire development process more robust.
