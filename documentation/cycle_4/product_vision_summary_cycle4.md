## 1. Primary Objective: Stabilize the Mobile Testing Foundation

Based on the critical failure identified in Cycle 3 (`FIND-01`), the primary and non-negotiable goal of Cycle 4 is to establish a stable and reliable testing environment for the Flutter mobile application.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- All Firebase-related `PlatformException` errors in the test environment must be resolved.
- A suite of basic widget and integration tests must be created and must pass consistently.
- This suite should include, at a minimum:
  - A test to verify the app starts and navigates to the login page correctly.
  - A basic widget test for the `GoalsPage` that mocks its repository and verifies the UI renders correctly in success and error states.
- The `test_helpers.dart` file must contain a robust and working Firebase mocking solution.

**This objective must be met before any new feature work is considered complete.**

## 2. Secondary Objective: Transaction Management MVP

Once the testing foundation is secure, this cycle will focus on implementing the MVP for Transaction Management. This is the next logical step in building the core functionality of the application.

### User Stories:
- **As a user, I want to manually add a new transaction (income or expense) so I can track my spending.**
- **As a user, I want to see a list of all my recent transactions so I can understand my financial activity.**
- **As a user, I want the AI assistant to be able to show me my recent transactions.**

### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Backend:** A new `TransactionsService` with endpoints for creating and listing transactions (`/transactions`).
- **Mobile:**
  - A new "Transactions" page accessible from the main navigation.
  - A form or dialog to manually add a new transaction (including description, amount, type, and date).
  - A list view to display recent transactions.
- **AI:**
  - A new `get_transactions` tool for the AI assistant.
  - The `AgentOrchestrator` must be updated to route queries like "show my recent transactions" to this new tool.
- **Data Persistence:** Transactions must be securely stored in and retrieved from Firestore.

## Conclusion

Cycle 4 is a "fix and build" cycle. By stabilizing the test environment, we pay down critical technical debt. By building the Transaction Management MVP, we continue to deliver core user value and move closer to the full product vision.
