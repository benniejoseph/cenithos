# Release Notes: Cycle 7

**Cycle Goal:** Resolve Mobile Testing Blockers & Introduce Real-Time AI Feedback.

**Status:** Completed, with a critical blocker identified.

---

## Executive Summary

Cycle 7 aimed to tackle two major objectives: finally stabilize the mobile test environment and introduce real-time streaming feedback to the AI assistant. While the AI feature was a success, the mobile testing issue has proven to be a persistent and critical blocker. After multiple failed attempts using various strategies (`FakeAsync`, `pumpAndSettle`, and manual timer control), the `flutter_animate` package continues to cause "Guarded function conflict" and timer leak errors in our widget tests. This blocker must be the top priority for the next cycle.

On the AI front, the implementation of real-time feedback was successful. The backend was refactored to use a streaming architecture, and the mobile client was updated to consume and display these real-time status updates, significantly improving the user experience during AI interactions.

## New Features & Key Changes

### ðŸš€ AI Backend: Streaming Responses
- **Refactored AI Orchestrator:** The `AgentOrchestrator` in `ai/core/orchestrator.py` was converted from a standard function into a generator, allowing it to `yield` updates at various stages of query processing.
- **Streaming API Endpoint:** The `/query` endpoint in `ai/main.py` was updated to return a `StreamingResponse`, sending newline-delimited JSON objects to the client.
- **Updated Integration Tests:** All integration tests in `ai/tests/test_integration.py` were refactored to handle the new streaming response format, and a new test was added to specifically validate the streaming flow. All tests are passing.

### ðŸ“± Mobile Frontend: Real-Time AI Feedback
- **Streaming Chat UI:** The `ChatPage` was refactored to use a `http.StreamedRequest`.
- **Live Status Updates:** The UI now listens to the response stream and displays intermediate messages from the AI (e.g., "Analyzing query...", "Calling tool...").
- **Final Response Handling:** The app correctly parses the final "complete" message from the stream and displays the result in the chat history.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Blockers & Known Issues

- **Mobile Widget Testing:** The `transactions_page_test.dart` remains fundamentally broken. The interaction between the `flutter_test` framework (specifically `fakeAsync`) and the `flutter_animate` package is causing untestable conditions ("Guarded function conflict").
  - **Impact:** This prevents us from writing reliable widget tests for any page that includes animations, severely impacting our ability to ensure UI quality and prevent regressions.
  - **Recommendation:** This must be the **#1 priority** for Cycle 8. We may need to explore alternatives to `flutter_animate` or find a fundamentally different testing strategy.

## Next Steps

- **Prioritize Mobile Test Fix:** Dedicate Cycle 8 to resolving the widget testing blocker.
- **Expand AI Capabilities:** With the streaming foundation in place, we can now build more complex, multi-step AI interactions.
