# Product Vision Summary: Cycle 7

**Cycle Goal:** Resolve Mobile Testing Blockers & Introduce Real-Time AI Feedback.

## 1. Vision & Strategy

The vision for Cycle 7 is to build **Confidence and Responsiveness**.

1.  **Confidence:** We will definitively solve the mobile testing blockers. This is our highest priority. A robust, fully automated test suite is essential for developer confidence, enabling faster, safer feature development and ensuring a high-quality, bug-free user experience. We cannot build a reliable app on an unreliable foundation.
2.  **Responsiveness:** We will make the AI assistant feel more alive and interactive. The current request-response model leaves the user waiting with a static screen. By introducing real-time feedback (like typing indicators and streaming responses), we will create a more engaging and modern user experience, reinforcing the perception of an intelligent agent at work.

## 2. User Problems & Target Audience

-   **Developers (Primary):** The core problem is the inability to write stable, asynchronous widget tests, which erodes confidence and slows development. This cycle will provide them with the tools and patterns to write reliable tests.
-   **End-Users (Secondary):** The user problem is the perception of a slow or unresponsive AI. When a query is submitted, the UI is idle, leaving the user to wonder if the system is working. Real-time feedback will solve this by making the AI's "thought process" visible.

## 3. High-Level Requirements

### Mobile Test Environment (Critical Priority)
-   **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a deep-dive investigation into the `flutter_animate` and `FutureProvider` conflicts with `flutter_test`.
-   **Stable Test Strategy:** Implement and document a definitive, stable strategy for testing asynchronous UI in Flutter. This may involve replacing problematic libraries if a workaround cannot be found.
-   **Full Test Coverage:** Achieve 100% test coverage for the `TransactionsPage`, including all states and filtering logic, with all tests passing reliably.

### Real-Time AI Feedback
-   **Streaming API:** The backend AI API will be refactored to support streaming responses, allowing it to send updates as it processes a query.
-   **Live UI Updates:** The mobile app's AI chat page will be updated to handle these streamed responses.
-   **Typing Indicator:** A "typing..." indicator will be displayed on the chat UI as soon as a query is submitted and will persist until the final response is received.

## 4. Success Metrics

-   **Mobile:** All tests in `transactions_page_test.dart` pass 10 consecutive times without any failures or pending timer errors.
-   **AI & Mobile Integration:** When a user queries the AI, a typing indicator appears within 500ms, and the AI's final response is streamed to the screen word-by-word (or chunk-by-chunk).
-   **Quality:** The "Known Issues" section of the release notes for Cycle 7 contains zero entries related to mobile testing.
