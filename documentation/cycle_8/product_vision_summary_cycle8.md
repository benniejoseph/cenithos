# Product Vision Summary: Cycle 8

## Goal

The single, overriding goal of Cycle 8 is to **resolve the mobile widget testing blocker**.

## Problem Statement

Our ability to write and run reliable widget tests is currently compromised by a persistent conflict between the `flutter_animate` package and the `fakeAsync` test environment. This results in "Guarded function conflict" and "pending timer" errors, making it impossible to validate UI components that use animations. This is not a feature-focused cycle; it is a critical engineering-health cycle required to unblock future development and ensure codebase stability.

## Success Criteria

The cycle will be considered a success when the `transactions_page_test.dart` suite and any other previously failing widget tests run successfully and reliably without errors.
