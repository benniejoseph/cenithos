# Architecture Analysis Report

This report, generated by Agent L2A1, details the architectural patterns and potential issues found in the CenthiosV2 codebase.

## Key Findings

1.  **Mixed State Management in Mobile App**: The Flutter application currently uses a mix of Provider and setState for state management. This inconsistency can make the app harder to debug and maintain.
    -   **Recommendation**: Standardize on the Provider package for all state management to ensure a single, predictable data flow.

2.  **Lack of Service Layer in Backend**: The backend Firebase Functions directly access Firestore within the route handlers. This couples the business logic to the database implementation and makes it difficult to test.
    -   **Recommendation**: Introduce a dedicated service layer to abstract all database interactions. This will improve separation of concerns and testability.

3.  **Monolithic AI Agent**: The `FinancialAssistantAgent` in the `ai` directory has grown too large and handles too many distinct responsibilities (parsing, analysis, response generation).
    -   **Recommendation**: Decompose the `FinancialAssistantAgent` into smaller, more specialized agents that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
