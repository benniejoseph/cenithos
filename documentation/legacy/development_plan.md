# Development Plan - Cycle 2

This plan, generated by Agent L1A3, outlines the actionable tasks required to bridge the gap between the current MVP and the full product vision.

## Phase 1: Foundational Backend & Core Data Models (Sprint 1-2)

### Epic: Core Feature Services

-   **User Story 1.1 (Backend)**: As a developer, I need to create a `GoalsService` with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing user financial goals.
-   **User Story 1.2 (Backend)**: As a developer, I need to create a `BudgetService` with full CRUD functionality for managing user budgets, including categories and spending limits.
-   **User Story 1.3 (Backend)**: As a developer, I need to update the Firestore database schema to include new collections for `goals` and `budgets`, with appropriate rules.
-   **User Story 1.4 (AI)**: As a developer, I need to implement the `AgentOrchestrator` to route basic queries to placeholder agents.

## Phase 2: Mobile UI Scaffolding & Initial 3D Integration (Sprint 3-4)

### Epic: Bringing "Spatial Finance" to Life

-   **User Story 2.1 (Mobile)**: As a developer, I need to create placeholder pages for all missing modules (Goals, Budgets, Investments, etc.) and integrate them into the main navigation shell.
-   **User Story 2.2 (Mobile)**: As a developer, I need to integrate the Spline Flutter runtime and create a proof-of-concept for the "Financial Universe" dashboard, rendering a simple 3D object.
-   **User Story 2.3 (Mobile)**: As a developer, I need to connect the mobile app to the new `GoalsService` and `BudgetService` to perform basic data fetching.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & AI Capabilities (Sprint 5-6)

### Epic: Intelligent Financial Advisory

-   **User Story 3.1 (AI)**: As a developer, I need to fully implement the `Alex - Expense Coach` agent, including its core advisory capabilities and tools for analyzing spending patterns.
-   **User Story 3.2 (AI)**: As a developer, I need to implement the `ContextManager` to store conversation history in Pinecone and provide relevant context to the AI agents.
-   **User Story 3.3 (Backend)**: As a developer, I need to implement the automated SMS parsing logic to extract transactions from text messages.
-   **User Story 3.4 (Mobile)**: As a developer, I need to build the interactive UI for the Goals module, allowing users to create, track, and update their financial goals.

## Phase 4: Gamification & Polish (Sprint 7-8)

### Epic: User Engagement & Delight

-   **User Story 4.1 (Backend)**: As a developer, I need to create a `GamificationService` to manage user XP, levels, and badges.
-   **User Story 4.2 (Mobile)**: As a developer, I need to implement the UI for displaying user levels, progress bars, and unlocked achievement badges.
