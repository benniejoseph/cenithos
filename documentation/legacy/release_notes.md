# Release Notes: Centhios v0.2.0 - "Spatial Finance" PoC

**Release Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Cycle:** 2 (Feature Development)  
**Status:** Completed  

---

## 1. Summary

This release marks the completion of a major development cycle focused on aligning the CenthiosV2 application with its core product vision: **"Spatial Finance"**. The primary goal was to analyze the existing codebase against high-level documentation, identify feature gaps, and implement foundational, proof-of-concept versions of the missing components.

This cycle was executed by a multi-agent coordination system, which successfully planned, designed, implemented, and verified the required features in a simulated environment.

## 2. Key Features & Accomplishments

This release introduces the foundational elements for three major epics. While these are currently placeholders or proofs-of-concept, they establish the architectural groundwork for future development.

### Epic 1: Core Financial Tools

*   **Goals Service (`backend/functions/src/services/goals.ts`):** A new backend service has been created to manage users' financial goals. The initial implementation includes stubs for creating, finding, and updating goals in Firestore.
*   **Budgets Service (`backend/functions/src/services/budgets.ts`):** A backend service for managing budgets has been created, with stubs for creating and finding user-specific budgets.
*   **Mobile UI Placeholders:**
    *   **Goals Page (`mobile/lib/presentation/pages/goals_page.dart`):** A new placeholder page has been added to the mobile app, providing a designated UI for future goal management features.
    *   **Budgets Page (`mobile/lib/presentation/pages/budgets_page.dart`):** A placeholder page for budget visualization and management.

### Epic 2: Spatial Finance UI Proof-of-Concept

*   **3D Scene Integration (`mobile/lib/presentation/pages/home_page.dart`):** The main home page of the mobile application has been transformed into a proof-of-concept for the "Spatial Finance" vision. It now successfully embeds and renders an interactive 3D scene from Spline using a `WebView`, validating the technical approach for the core user experience.

### Epic 3: AI-Powered Assistance

*   **Refactored AI Architecture (`ai/core`):** The Python-based AI service has been significantly refactored.
    *   `AgentOrchestrator`: A new orchestrator now manages the routing of user queries to different conceptual agents.
    *   `ContextManager`: A simplified, in-memory context manager has been implemented to maintain conversational state.
*   **New AI API (`ai/main.py`):** The FastAPI application has been updated to expose a new `/query` endpoint, which serves as the primary interface for the mobile app to interact with the AI services.

## 3. Testing & Verification

*   **Integration Testing:** Automated tests were created to validate the new AI API endpoints and the rendering of the new mobile UI pages. All tests passed.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The implemented placeholders and the 3D PoC were reviewed and formally **approved**, confirming their alignment with the project's strategic direction.

## 4. Next Steps

With this foundational work complete, the project is now positioned to begin detailed implementation of these features in the next development cycle.
