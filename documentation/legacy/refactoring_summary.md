# Refactoring Summary

This document, generated by Agent L3A1, outlines the refactoring tasks performed to address issues identified in Layer 2.

## Changes Implemented

1.  **Backend: Implemented Service Layer**
    -   **Issue**: Direct database access in route handlers (`architecture_analysis.md`).
    -   **Change**: Created a `services` directory in `backend/functions/src`. Abstracted all Firestore queries into a new `TransactionService`. Route handlers now call this service, decoupling them from the database.

2.  **Security: Removed Hard-coded API Key**
    -   **Issue**: Hard-coded key in `backend/functions/src/auth.ts` (`security_vulnerability_report.json`).
    -   **Change**: Moved the API key to a `.env` file and used `dotenv` to load it at runtime. Added `.env` to `.gitignore`.

3.  **Performance: Optimized Database Query**
    -   **Issue**: N+1 query in `getTransactionsForUser` (`performance_hotspots.json`).
    -   **Change**: Refactored the query to fetch all required category details in a single, initial query, eliminating the N+1 problem.
