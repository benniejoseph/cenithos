# Mobile UI Specification - Cycle 2

This specification, generated by Agent L2A2, details the UI/UX architecture for the new features outlined in the development plan.

## 1. New Placeholder Screens

To facilitate parallel development, the following placeholder pages must be created and integrated into the main navigation shell (e.g., in a "More" or "Features" tab). Each page should have a basic `AppBar` and a centered `Text` widget indicating its purpose.

-   `goals_page.dart`
-   `budgets_page.dart`
-   `investments_page.dart`
-   `bills_page.dart`
-   `tax_page.dart`

## 2. Proof of Concept: "Financial Universe" Dashboard

This task focuses on integrating the Spline 3D runtime into the `home_page.dart` as a proof of concept.

-   **User Story**: 2.2
-   **Objective**: Replace the current static home page with an interactive 3D scene.
-   **Requirements**:
    1.  Add the `spline_flutter` package to `pubspec.yaml`.
    2.  Create a simple 3D scene in Spline (e.g., a rotating cube or sphere).
    3.  Export the scene from Spline and load it into the `HomePage` widget using `Spline.network('YOUR_SPLINE_URL')`.
    4.  The scene should be interactive (e.g., users can rotate the object with touch gestures).
-   **Acceptance Criteria**: The home page displays a controllable 3D object, proving the integration works. The object does not need to be connected to real data at this stage.

## 3. Goals Module UI - Phase 1

-   **User Story**: 3.4
-   **Objective**: Build the initial UI for the financial goals feature.
-   **Component: `GoalListItem`**
    -   A reusable widget that displays a goal's name, progress bar, and current/target amounts.
-   **Component: `GoalCreationDialog`**
    -   A modal dialog that contains a form for creating a new goal (name, target amount, etc.).
-   **Page: `GoalsPage`**
    -   Displays a list of `GoalListItem` widgets fetched from the `GoalsService`.
    -   Includes a Floating Action Button that opens the `GoalCreationDialog`.
