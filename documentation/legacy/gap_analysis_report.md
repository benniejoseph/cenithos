# Gap Analysis Report

This report, generated by Agent L1A2, details the features and components that are missing from the current implementation when compared against the full product vision.

## 1. Overall Summary

The current implementation is a minimal viable product (MVP) that covers basic user authentication, transaction viewing, and a placeholder for AI chat. The gap between the current state and the full "Spatial Finance" vision is **significant**. The foundational backend and mobile structures exist, but are missing the majority of the features, the sophisticated UI, and the advanced AI capabilities.

## 2. Mobile UI/UX Gaps (High Priority)

-   **Core UI Philosophy**: The current UI is a standard, 2D Flutter application. The entire "Spatial Finance" 3D concept with Spline visualizations is **completely missing**.
-   **Missing Screen Modules**: Based on `cenithos-screen-navigation-map.md`, the following major modules are absent:
    -   Onboarding & Initial Setup (Carousel, Financial Profile, etc.)
    -   Goals & Planning
    -   Budgeting
    -   Investments
    -   Bill & Subscription Management
    -   Tax Management
-   **Gamification**: The entire XP, level, and badging system is not implemented.
-   **AI Assistant UI**: The current `ai_assistant_page` and `chat_page` are placeholders. The immersive, holographic agent interface is not present.

## 3. Backend Gaps (High Priority)

-   **Missing Microservices**: The architecture specifies multiple services, but only `Auth` and `Transactions` have a basic implementation. The following are missing:
    -   **Report Service**: No endpoints for generating monthly summaries, tax reports, etc.
    -   **AI Integration Service**: No endpoints for routing queries to the Python AI service.
    -   **Goals Service, Budget Service, etc.**: No backend logic for any of the missing feature modules.
-   **Data Ingestion**: While there is a controller for `saveImportedTransactions`, there is no implementation for automated SMS/Email parsing or receipt scanning (OCR).
-   **Database Schema**: The Firestore schema is likely missing collections for goals, budgets, investments, bills, and user-specific AI settings.

## 4. AI Service Gaps (Medium Priority)

-   **Agent Implementation**: The `ai/` directory contains a basic structure, but the 6 specialized financial agents (Alex, Emma, etc.) are not fully implemented with their described advisory capabilities and tools.
-   **Context Management**: The `ContextManager` for handling conversation history and user context with a vector database (Pinecone) is not implemented.
-   **Agent Orchestrator**: The `AgentOrchestrator` for routing user queries to the appropriate agent based on intent is not implemented.

## 5. Recommendations for Next Steps

1.  **Prioritize Backend Development**: Build out the core missing services (Goals, Budgets, Investments) and the corresponding API endpoints first, as the UI and AI will depend on them.
2.  **Scaffold Mobile UI**: Create placeholder screens for all the missing modules to build out the navigation shell.
3.  **Iterate on UI/UX**: Begin with a single 3D component (e.g., the "Financial Universe" dashboard) as a proof-of-concept for the Spline integration before rolling it out to all screens.
4.  **Develop AI in Parallel**: The AI agents can be developed and tested in parallel with the backend and frontend work.
