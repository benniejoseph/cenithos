## 1. UAT Objective

To validate that the features implemented in Layer 3, although in a placeholder or Proof-of-Concept (PoC) state, align with the strategic goals outlined in the `product_vision_summary.md` and meet the acceptance criteria of the user stories in the `development_plan.md`.

*   **Epic 1: Core Financial Tools**
    *   User Story: Goals Management (Placeholder UI)
    *   User Story: Budgets Management (Placeholder UI)
*   **Epic 2: Spatial Finance UI**
    *   User Story: 3D Visualization PoC
*   **Epic 3: AI-Powered Assistance**
    *   User Story: AI Query Routing

## 3. UAT Results

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Reviewer Notes | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goals Management** | A placeholder page for goals exists and is accessible. | The `GoalsPage` is present and clearly marked as a placeholder. The foundation is laid for future development. | **APPROVED** |
| **Budgets Management**| A placeholder page for budgets exists and is accessible. | The `BudgetsPage` is present and functional as a placeholder. Approved for further development. | **APPROVED** |
| **3D Visualization PoC** | The home page demonstrates the ability to render an interactive 3D scene. | The `HomePage` successfully loads a Spline scene via a `WebView`. This PoC validates the technical feasibility of the "Spatial Finance" concept. | **APPROVED** |
| **AI Query Routing** | The AI service can receive a query and route it to a conceptual agent. | The `/query` endpoint correctly routes requests based on simple keywords. The AI service architecture is validated. | **APPROVED** |

## 4. Final Verdict

All placeholder features and the Proof-of-Concept for the "Spatial Finance" vision have been **approved**. The development work accurately reflects the initial designs and plans. The project is cleared to proceed to the final release management stage.
