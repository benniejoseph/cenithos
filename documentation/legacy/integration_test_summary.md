**Timestamp:** 2025-07-01T12:50:00Z  
**Status:** Completed

## 1. Objective

To perform integration testing on the new features developed during Layer 3. This includes the backend service stubs, the mobile UI placeholders, and the refactored AI service API.

## 2. Test Suites Executed

| Codebase | Test File                                    | Description                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI       | `ai/tests/test_integration.py`               | Tested the FastAPI endpoints (`/` and `/query`) for the AI service.           |
| Mobile   | `mobile/test/widget/feature_integration_test.dart` | Tested the rendering of the new `GoalsPage`, `BudgetsPage`, and `HomePage`. |

## 3. Results

| Test Suite                                  | Status    | Notes                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Service Endpoint Tests                   | **PASSED**  | The orchestrator correctly routes queries to the financial and general agents. The API models are functioning as expected.             |
| Mobile Feature Placeholder Tests            | **PASSED**  | All new pages (`Goals`, `Budgets`, `Home`) render their placeholder content correctly. The `HomePage` correctly loads the `WebViewWidget`. |

## 4. Conclusion

All automated integration tests for the placeholder features have passed successfully. The new components are correctly stubbed and integrated at a foundational level. The system is now ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to verify the implementation against the product vision and requirements.
